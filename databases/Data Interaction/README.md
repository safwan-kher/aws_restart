# Database Interaction and Transaction Exercises - Solutions

Here we provide solutions and explanations for the exercises based on the topic of Database Interaction and Transaction.

## Exercise 1: Role-play Exercise

**Solution:**

The solution to this exercise will vary depending on the creativity and understanding of the participants. However, each role should interact with the database as follows:

- Application Developer: Demonstrates creating an application that interacts with the database, possibly showing how they would embed SQL commands into the application code.
- End User: Demonstrates using an application to access and possibly update data in the database.
- Data Analyst: Demonstrates using SQL commands to view and manipulate data in the database.
- Database Administrator: Demonstrates managing the database and tables, possibly showing how they would use SQL commands to ensure the consistency, quality, and security of the database.

## Exercise 2: SQL Command Exercise

**Solution:**

The solution to this exercise will depend on the specific scenarios given. However, here are some examples of SQL commands a Data Analyst or Database Administrator might use:

- SELECT * FROM Employees; (This command selects all data from the Employees table)
- UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 50000 WHERE EmployeeID = 1; (This command updates the salary of the employee with an ID of 1 to 50000)

## Exercise 3: Interaction Model Exercise

**Solution:**

The solution to this exercise will depend on the understanding and creativity of the participants. However, each model should be explained as follows:

- Client-Server Model: The client application sends a request to the server over the network. The server processes the request and sends the response back to the client.
- Embedded Application Code Model: The application developer embeds SQL commands into the application code. The application then interacts with the database using these commands.
- Three-Tier Application with Web Application Model: The user interacts with the web application, which sends requests to the application server. The application server then interacts with the database server, which processes the requests and sends the responses back to the application server.

## Exercise 4: Transaction State Exercise

**Solution:**

The solution to this exercise will depend on the specific scenarios given. However, here are some examples of how to identify the state of a transaction:

- Active: The transaction has started and is in progress.
- Partially Committed: The final statement has been executed, but the transaction has not yet been committed.
- Failed: The system has found that the transaction cannot proceed due to some error.
- Aborted: The transaction has been rolled back and the database has been returned to its state before the transaction began.
- Committed: The changes have been saved and the transaction is considered successful.

## Exercise 5: Case Study

**Solution:**

The solution to this exercise will depend on the specific case study given. However, the participants should consider the following when choosing a database interaction model:

- The size and complexity of the company.
- The number of departments that need to access the database.
- The level of database expertise among the employees.
- The need for real-time data access and updates.
- The security requirements of the company.
