# Database Interaction and Transaction Exercises

Here you are provided a step-by-step guide to exercises based on the topic of Database Interaction and Transaction. 

## Exercise 1: Role-play Exercise

**Objective:** Understand the different roles interacting with a database.

**Steps:**

1. Divide the participants into four groups. Each group will represent one of the following roles: Application Developer, End User, Data Analyst, Database Administrator.

2. Each group will research and discuss how their assigned role interacts with a database.

3. Each group will then present a role-play demonstrating their role's interaction with a database. They should explain the actions they are taking and why these actions are relevant to their role.

## Exercise 2: SQL Command Exercise

**Objective:** Practice writing SQL commands for direct database interaction.

**Steps:**

1. Each participant will be given a scenario that a Data Analyst or Database Administrator might encounter.

2. Participants will write SQL commands that would be used to address the scenario.

3. Participants will then share and discuss their commands, explaining why they chose those specific commands.

## Exercise 3: Interaction Model Exercise

**Objective:** Understand the different models of database interaction.

**Steps:**

1. Participants will be divided into three groups. Each group will be assigned one of the following models: client-server model, embedded application code model, and three-tier application with a web application model.

2. Each group will draw a diagram of their assigned model, labeling each part of the model.

3. Each group will then explain how data flows through their model, using their diagram as a visual aid.

## Exercise 4: Transaction State Exercise

**Objective:** Understand the different states of a database transaction.

**Steps:**

1. Each participant will be given a series of scenarios involving database transactions.

2. Participants will identify the state of the transaction (Active, Partially Committed, Failed, Aborted, Committed) in each scenario.

3. Participants will then share and discuss their answers, explaining why they identified each transaction as being in the state they chose.

## Exercise 5: Case Study

**Objective:** Apply knowledge of database interaction models to a real-world scenario.

**Steps:**

1. Participants will be given a case study of a company that needs to integrate its database across different departments.

2. Participants will suggest the best type of database interaction model for this company.

3. Participants will then justify their choice, explaining why they believe their chosen model is the best fit for the company in the case study.
