# Solutions for Database Interaction and Transaction Exercises

Here you're provided solutions to the exercises on understanding database interactions and transactions. We will cover the solutions for understanding different roles that interact with databases, transaction states in a Database Management System (DBMS), and primary models for database interaction.

## Solution for Exercise 1: Understanding Roles that Interact with Databases

1. **End Users**: These are the individuals who use the applications that interact with the database. They might not interact with the database directly, but they use the data stored in it through an application interface.

2. **Data Analysts**: They use specialized tools to query the database and analyze the data. They might use SQL queries or data analysis software to extract data and derive insights.

3. **Database Administrators**: They interact with the database using administrative tools. They are responsible for managing the database, ensuring its performance, availability, and security.

4. **Application Developers**: They use programming languages and development tools to build applications that interact with the database. They write code to implement the logic of the application and to manage the data in the database.

## Solution for Exercise 2: Understanding Transaction States in a DBMS

1. **Active State**: This is the initial state of a transaction. The transaction remains in this state while it is executing its operations.

2. **Partially Committed State**: When a transaction has executed all its operations but has not yet been committed, it is in this state.

3. **Failed State**: If a transaction encounters an error during its execution and cannot proceed, it enters this state.

4. **Aborted State**: If a transaction is in the failed state and cannot be recovered, it is aborted and all its changes are rolled back.

5. **Committed State**: When a transaction has successfully executed all its operations and the changes have been saved in the database, it is in the committed state.

## Solution for Exercise 3: Understanding Primary Models for Database Interaction

1. **Client-Server Model**: In this model, the client sends a request to the server. The server processes the request, interacts with the database, and sends the response back to the client.

2. **Application Developer Interaction**: In this model, developers write code that directly interacts with the database. The application performs the CRUD operations on the database.

3. **Three-Tier Application with Web Application**: In this model, the user interface sends requests to the business logic layer. The business logic layer processes the request, interacts with the database, and sends the response back to the user interface.

By understanding these solutions, you will have a better understanding of database interactions and transactions.
